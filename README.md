CSCN8010 Practical Lab 2: Multivariate Linear Regression, Non-Parametric Models and Cross-Validation

## Objective

To build a model that can best predict the risk of diabetes progression. This will be used as a screening tool to help physicians with identifying patients at risk. The models that we look into are:

1. Univariate polynomial regression models
2. Multivariate Polynomial models
3. Decision Trees
4. kNNs

In this lab we will evaluate the models using R-squared, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. To do that we will run a train-validation-test split.
